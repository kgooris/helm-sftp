# helm-sftp
A Helm SFTP chart based on atmoz/sftp

I was searching on a simple SFTP server that I could install on a kubernetes cluster

default login
login: demo
password: demo

directory available in the container /home

I extend it later with putting more arguments and allow customization using --set and values.yaml file
